# CI_CD_Tutorial
A repository to demonstrate CI and CD in GitHub

# Project Summary

The aim of the repository is to provide a tutorial on CICD in github. CICD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Development.
In Software development, software development is often fast-paced. CICD can helps to assure the product quality while enhancing development efficiency.

In brief, benefits of CICD are:
1. Faster delivery: through automation of many manual processes
2. Improved code quality: Automated testing in CI cateches bugs earluy. Each code merge triggers tests, to detect issues before reaching production
3. Reduced Risk: Frequent smaller deployments make it easier to detect and fix issues early, minimizing the chance of major disruptions. CICD pipelines have rollback mechanisms for quicl recovery if problems arise
4. Increased efficiency: Automation of integration and testing and deployment processes allow developers to focus on writing code other than manual tasks.
5. Better Collaboration: With CICD, teams are smaller and can work on specific items without conflicting with others
6. Continuous Feedback: The automated deployment process in CD allows for swift observation of software performance in production, enabliing faster/quick response to problems and issues when they arise.
